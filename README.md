# Aldrich-Recreation
My final project for Computational Biology in Spring 2022 (CS 4501). it involved recreating a <a href=http://www.iaees.org/publications/journals/nb/articles/2011-1(2)/Diffusion-limited-aggregation-fractal-evolution-gene-promoter.pdf>paper</a> by <a href=https://www.ben.edu/college-of-science/people/aldrich.cfm>Professor Preston R. Aldrich</a> at <a href=https://www.ben.edu/index.cfm>Benedictine University</a> published on September 1, 2011.

<h1>The fractal data.pkl file contains the findings of the fractals so you don't have to re-run the program unless you specifically want to view the graphical figures.</h1>
